Low-cost Automated Pet Feeder System

#
**1. Title of the Project**
Low-cost Automated Pet Feeder System

#
**2.Purpose- reason why this system is needed**

  In this project creates a low-cost automated pet feeder system for cats and dogs. 
  This system verifies pets are feeding on specific time frame. 
  It has a fixed schedule, identifies current food level, notify to staff when refilling requirement needed.

#
**3.Features- Pointed out what are the main points system will do.**
•	By using current time distributes food at specific scheduled time 
•	Identify bowl weight and food level in the bowl by using level sensors.
•	When foods are running low return a notification sound via buzzer.
•	Using level sensor, LEDs, motors create a flexible design.
•	When bowl weight is not changing send a notification by mentioning pets are not eating

#
**4.How the system implements-step by step describes how it works** 

  i. Low-cost automated pet feeder system reads current time and verifies feeding time.
  ii. If it is feeding time, check the current food level by using hopper sensor.
  iii. If food is available, motor moves and distribute food.
  iv. Then after 10 minutes, by using weight sensor calculating bowl weight increase or not.
    •	If bowl weight increase YES- pet feeding successful.
    •	If bowl weight increase NO- automated system sends notification by mentioning pet is not eating.
  v. If food is running low, the automated system notifies staff with a sound and light (buzzer and LED) 

#
**5.Hardware equipment used**

  •	Microcontroller
  •	Real Time Clock 
  •	Weight sensor
  •	LEDs
  •	Buzzer
  •	Servo motor
  •	Power Supply

  #
**6. Further Improvements**

  •	Add control portions for different pets
  •	Add camera to identify which of the pet eating or not.
  •	Notification sends via mobile phone by implementing a mobile app
