Problem Statement
 An animal shelter wants the cheapest cost with a programmable automated pet feeder for cats and dogs. It should distribute foods in a specific schedule, identify consumption, and return warning to working staff if there are any problems encountered. 
That solution should be created with weight sensors,common electronics like LEDs, power supply, motors,regulators and so on.

#
Assumptions:
Specific type of food for all the pets.
Available memory space and how long processing power can apply (microcontroller-level hardware).
Pets have specific feeding times per day (e.g., twice a day or thrice a day-breakfast, lunch and dinner).
When reducing the foods, staff may get some notification or warning sound or message it is time to refill. 

#
Inputs:
Input real-time clock to specifically when feeding time starts
identify food level currently by using sensors.
Measure the weight when starting and ending the feed by using a weight sensor.

#
Outputs:
Distribute food
Give a warning message with sound to working staff when foods are lacking. It should have a pop up light with a sound or buzzer or notification message.
