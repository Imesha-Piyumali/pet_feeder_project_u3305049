Step_04_Implement the solution

1.START
2.Get current time
3.If current equal to pet feeding schedule
 THEN
           	a-Read pet food level via sensor
           	b-IF pet food level> 15% THEN
                          	i.Rotate motor 90 degrees to distribute pet food
                          	ii.Wait 10 minutes
                          	iii.Identify bowl weight
                          	iv.IF weight increase<threshold THEN
                          	Send notification “Pet was not eaten”
           	END IF
 ELSE
           	Send notification “Pet food bowl is empty”
 END IF
4.Repeat These steps continuously
5.END
